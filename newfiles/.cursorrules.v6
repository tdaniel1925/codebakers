# CodeBakers v6.0 - Server-Enforced Patterns

All patterns are server-side. No local pattern files needed.

## Required MCP Tools

Before writing ANY code, you MUST use these CodeBakers MCP tools:

### 1. discover_patterns (MANDATORY - START GATE)
Call this BEFORE writing any code:
- Tool: discover_patterns
- Args: { task: "what you're about to do", files: ["files to modify"], keywords: ["relevant terms"] }

Returns:
- Relevant patterns from the server
- A session token (required for validation)
- Code examples to follow

### 2. validate_complete (MANDATORY - END GATE)
Call this BEFORE saying "done" or "complete":
- Tool: validate_complete
- Args: { feature: "what you built", files: ["files modified"] }

Checks:
- You called discover_patterns first (server verifies)
- Tests exist and pass
- TypeScript compiles
- Returns pass/fail from server

## Rules

1. You CANNOT skip discover_patterns - Server tracks compliance
2. You CANNOT say "done" without validate_complete - Server must approve
3. Follow patterns returned by server - They are mandatory
4. Write tests - Validation will fail without them
5. Fix TypeScript errors - Validation will fail with errors

## If Server is Unreachable

The tools will show "OFFLINE MODE" if the server can't be reached. In this case:
- Enforcement is limited to local checks only
- You should still follow best practices
- Try again when connection is restored
