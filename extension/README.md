# CodeBakers - Stop Fixing AI Mistakes

**Cursor and Claude Code ignore your standards. CodeBakers enforces them.**

Save 20+ hours per project. Get production-ready code the first time — not code you have to fix.

## The Problem with AI Coding Tools

You've tried Cursor. You've tried Claude Code. They're fast, but:

- They **ignore your coding standards** and write inconsistent code
- They **skip error handling** and leave you debugging in production
- They **forget your context** mid-conversation and repeat mistakes
- They **say "done" without tests** and you ship broken features

**You end up spending hours fixing AI-generated code.** That's not saving time — that's shifting work.

## How CodeBakers is Different

| Cursor / Claude Code | CodeBakers |
|---------------------|------------|
| Suggests patterns in CLAUDE.md | **Enforces patterns** — loads them before every response |
| Context lost when window compacts | **Perfect recall** — context persists automatically |
| Says "done" without validation | **Two-gate system** — won't complete without tests passing |
| Generates inconsistent code | **40+ production modules** — same quality, every time |
| You pay for tokens AND your time | **$99/mo unlimited** — save 20+ hours, pay for itself |

## Real Results

- **20+ hours saved** per project (no more fixing AI mistakes)
- **95%+ pattern compliance** (vs ~30% with CLAUDE.md alone)
- **10x ROI** on your first build
- **Zero token limits** — unlimited Claude API usage

## What's Included

### Guaranteed Enforcement
- Patterns loaded **before** every response (not suggested, enforced)
- Two-gate validation: patterns in, tests out
- Guardian system auto-detects broken imports and type errors

### 40+ Production Modules
- **Auth** — OAuth, 2FA, sessions, password reset
- **Database** — Drizzle, migrations, queries, transactions
- **API** — Validation, rate limiting, error handling
- **Payments** — Stripe subscriptions, webhooks, refunds
- **Testing** — Playwright, Vitest, CI/CD
- **And 35 more** — Frontend, integrations, performance, security

### Perfect Recall
Your context **never gets lost**, even in long sessions:
- Project state persisted to `.codebakers.json`
- Development log in `.codebakers/DEVLOG.md`
- Blockers tracked in `.codebakers/BLOCKED.md`

## Pricing

**$99/month** — Unlimited usage, unlimited projects, no token limits.

**14-day free trial** — Full access, no credit card required.

Compare to the cost of:
- 20 hours of your time fixing AI code @ $100/hr = **$2,000**
- CodeBakers for a year = **$1,188**

**ROI: 1,682% in year one.**
